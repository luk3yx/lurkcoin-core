# lurkcoin

This is the core code of the current release of
[lurkcoin](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=22768).

## Installation

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org) 1.13 or later installed.

To run lurkcoin, you can just install the lurkcoin-core binary:

```
$ go get github.com/luk3yx/lurkcoin-core
$ lurkcoin-core /path/to/config.yaml
```

*If you get a command not found error, you may have to run
~/go/bin/lurkcoin-core instead.*

I advise against importing `github.com/luk3yx/lurkcoin-core` in your own Go
code, any functions or types can and will change in future releases.

## Restoring the database from a backup

```
$ go get github.com/luk3yx/lurkcoin-core/cmd/...
$ lurkcoin-restore-backup /path/to/config.yaml /path/to/backup.json
```

## Configuration

See config.yaml for a list of configuration options.

## Compilation flags

The following compilation flags are supported:

 - `lurkcoin.disablebbolt`: Disables the bbolt database. If this flag is used,
    bbolt does not need to be installed.
 - `lurkcoin.disableplaintextdb`: Disables the plaintext database.
 - `lurkcoin.disablev2api`: Disables version 2 of the API. This can also be
    done at runtime in config.yaml.
